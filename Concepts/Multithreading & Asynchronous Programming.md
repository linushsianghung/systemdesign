#### Question: For Java, does the asynchronous call leverage network poller mechanism under the hood? If not, what the mechanism it uses?
Great question 👍 In Java, whether an asynchronous call leverages a network poller mechanism under the hood depends on which API / library you’re using. Let’s break this down:
- **Classic Java I/O (java.net, java.io)**
   - Blocking I/O: Each socket or stream read/write operation blocks the calling **OS thread** until data is available. 
   - No poller: Here the kernel does the blocking; the JVM just parks the thread until the call returns.

- **Java NIO (New I/O) – java.nio.channels (since Java 1.4)**
   - This introduces **non-blocking I/O** and selectors.
   - Under the hood:
     - JVM uses the OS-specific **network poller APIs**:
       - epoll on Linux,
       - kqueue on BSD/macOS,
       - IOCP (I/O Completion Ports) on Windows.
     - Java’s `Selector` abstracts these pollers.
   - Mechanism: A single (or a few) threads run the selector loop → demultiplex readiness events → dispatch tasks.
So here, yes, it’s explicitly leveraging the **network poller**.

- **Asynchronous I/O – java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel (Java 7 NIO.2)**
   - Uses true **asynchronous I/O** provided by the OS:
     - On Linux: depends on implementation — can be based on a thread pool + blocking I/O, or on native epoll .
     - On Windows: backed by **IOCP** (true async).
   - JVM hides differences, but usually:
     - Windows: real kernel async I/O.
     - Linux/macOS: thread-pool-based implementation (worker threads block on socket ops).
So this may or may not use a poller — on Windows it doesn’t need a poller (kernel notifies directly), but on Linux it often still relies on a poller or worker threads.

- **Framework-level async (CompletableFuture, Spring WebFlux, Netty, etc.)**
   - **Netty**: explicitly uses the **network poller** (epoll, kqueue, IOCP).
   - **Spring WebFlux** (reactor-netty): builds on Netty → so yes, poller-based.
   - **CompletableFuture / ExecutorService** async calls: not network poller related at
   all → just runs tasks on a thread pool asynchronously.

✅ Summary:
   - If you use Java NIO (Selector , Netty, WebFlux) → async is built on top of the OS network poller (epoll/kqueue/IOCP).
   - If you use AsynchronousSocketChannel (NIO.2) → Windows = true async (IOCP, no poller loop); Linux/macOS = often thread pool + poller.
   - If you use CompletableFuture or thread-based async → no poller, just thread scheduling.

#### Question: Could you please tell me more about how CompletableFuture using threads to run asynchronously?
Perfect follow-up 👌 Let’s unpack how CompletableFuture in Java achieves asynchrony.

- *Basic idea**
CompletableFuture itself is just a container for a result that will be available in the future. It doesn’t create threads or poll sockets by itself. Instead, it delegates execution to a thread pool (usually ForkJoinPool.commonPool() unless you specify another Executor ).
So when you call something like:
```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> doWork());
```
what happens is:
1. The lambda (doWork() ) is wrapped in a ForkJoinTask .
2. That task is submitted to an executor (by default, the ForkJoinPool.commonPool ).
3. A worker thread from the pool runs it asynchronously.
4. Once it finishes, the result is stored in the CompletableFuture and dependent
   stages (like thenApply , thenCompose ) are scheduled to run.

- **Threading details**
  - **Default executor** → `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` (shared pool).
    - Number of threads ≈ number of available processors (Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() ).
    - Each worker runs tasks in a work-stealing model (workers can steal tasks from others’ queues to stay busy).
  - **Custom executor** → you can pass your own ExecutorService then your task runs on myExecutor’s threads.
    ```java
    CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() → fetchData(), myExecutor);
    ```

- **Scheduling dependent stages**
  - By default, `thenApply` , `thenAccept` , etc. run in the **same thread** that completed the future (synchronous chaining).
    - If you want async continuation, you use `thenApplyAsync` , `thenAcceptAsync` , etc.
      - Those will again submit the continuation to the pool (or given executor).
        - Example:
          ```java
          CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(this::fetchData)
            .thenApplyAsync(this::parse)  // runs on another thread
            .thenAcceptAsync(this::store); 
          ```
- Important differences from poller-based async
  - **CompletableFuture** is about **task parallelism**, not _I/O readiness_.
  - It **does not use a network poller**. Instead:
    - If your task is `CPU-bound` → perfect use case (parallel execution on multiple threads).
    - If your task is `I/O-bound` (like waiting on a socket) → you’re just wasting a thread, because it blocks until data arrives.
That’s why for non-blocking I/O, libraries like `Netty` or `Spring WebFlux` combine the poller model (few threads, event-driven) with **CompletableFuture /Mono /Flux** style composition.

✅ Summary in one line:
CompletableFuture achieves asynchrony by **submitting tasks to a thread pool (usually ForkJoinPool)**, where worker threads execute them in parallel; it doesn’t leverage OS-level I/O pollers


#### Question: From Java 21, the virtual is released. I guess virtual thread use the network poller mechanism under the hood, right?
Excellent intuition 🚀 Let’s walk through this carefully — because Java 21’s virtual threads (Project Loom)do integrate with the OS’s network poller mechanism, but not in the same way as NIO or Netty.

🔎 **What are virtual threads?**
- A **virtual thread** is a lightweight thread managed by the JVM, not the OS.
- They’re still scheduled by the Java runtime, but mounted on a `carrier thread` (a real OS thread) when running.
- When a virtual thread blocks on I/O, the JVM **parks** it and frees up the carrier thread → allowing many virtual threads to share few OS threads.

⚙ **How does blocking I/O become cheap?**
Normally, Socket.read() or InputStream.read() blocks the OS thread. With Loom, that would kill scalability. So the JVM does some magic:
- On **Linux/macOS**:
  - Virtual threads use **Java’s NIO** under the hood (epoll/kqueue).
  - When a virtual thread calls a blocking I/O method (e.g., read() ), the JVM intercepts it and actually registers the socket with the OS poller.
  - The virtual thread is **suspended** (unmounted from its carrier thread).
  - When data arrives, the poller wakes the virtual thread and re-mounts it on an available carrier thread.
- On **Windows**:
  - Backed by **IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)**, which is Windows’ true async I/O model.
  - The virtual thread is suspended until the I/O completion event arrives, then resumed.

So yes ✅: virtual threads internally _rely on the OS network poller (epoll/kqueue/IOCP)_ to make blocking I/O appear cheap.

🧩 **Comparison**
- **OS thread + blocking I/O (classic Java I/O)** → 1 thread per connection, scales poorly.
- **Virtual thread + blocking I/O (Java 21)**
  → Many virtual threads multiplexed over few carrier threads. 
  → JVM uses _poller mechanisms under the hood_ to suspend/resume virtual threads on I/O readiness.
- **Netty/WebFlux (reactive)** → You manage async explicitly; poller events drive callbacks/futures.
- **Virtual threads** → JVM makes poller-based async _look like blocking I/O_. Developers just write simple blocking code, but get poller-level scalability.

✅ Summary: Yes — Java 21 virtual threads use network poller mechanisms (epoll, kqueue, IOCP) under the hood. The JVM intercepts blocking I/O calls, parks the virtual thread, and resumes it when the OS signals readiness, all without tying up an OS thread.
